# :dollar: E-Commerce Attempt

 This is my attempt to mimic an E-Bay using smart contracts.
 
 ## :watch: The Game

The game is created using an Auction format. Buyers can bid on items that Sellers will provide to the option. Only one item is actioned off each time. Sellers create the auction and designate a time limit. At the end of the auction, item will go to the highest bidder, and the "trade" will occur.
